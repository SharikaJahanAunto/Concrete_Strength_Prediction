# Concrete Strength Prediction

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using various machine learning regression models. The dataset contains features such as the amount of cement, water, and aggregate used, and the target variable is `strength`, which represents the compressive strength of the concrete.

## Project Workflow:

1. **Dataset Overview**:  
   The dataset contains features related to concrete composition, and the target variable is `strength`. It was loaded and inspected for missing values, outliers, and scaling needs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Checked and handled missing values (if any).
   - Detected and visualized outliers using boxplots.
   - Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` for consistent model training.

3. **Model Selection**:  
   Three regression models were chosen:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

4. **Model Training**:  
   - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
   - Trained the selected models on the training dataset.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   Each model was evaluated using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared (R²) score

6. **Model Performance**:

   | Model               | MAE      | MSE       | RMSE     | R²      |
   |---------------------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
   | Linear Regression    | 7.7456   | 95.9709   | 9.7965   | 0.6276  |
   | Random Forest        | 3.7385   | 29.9422   | 5.4719   | 0.8838  |
   | Gradient Boosting    | 4.1350   | 30.1769   | 5.4934   | 0.8829  |

7. **Feature Importance**:  
   For tree-based models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential factors affecting concrete strength.

8. **Hyperparameter Tuning** (Optional):  
   Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for Random Forest to optimize model performance.

9. **Conclusion**:  
   - **Random Forest Regressor** was the best-performing model with the lowest error and highest R² score, making it the most reliable model for concrete strength prediction.
   - **Gradient Boosting** was competitive but slightly less effective.
   - **Linear Regression** underperformed, likely due to the complexity of the data.

## Instructions for Running:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook in Google Colab or any local environment to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Future Improvements:
- Further tuning of hyperparameters for Gradient Boosting.
- Exploration of more advanced models like neural networks for better performance.
